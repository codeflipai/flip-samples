## Generative AI Pipelines

### Description

Generative AI Pipelines consist of a series of AI components arranged sequentially, where each component performs a specific function, transforming the data step by step. This pattern enables the creation of complex outputs through layered processing, similar to an assembly line in manufacturing.

### Components

-  **Input Module**: Collects and preprocesses raw data.
-  **Processing Modules**: Multiple AIs that perform specific transformations (e.g., data cleaning, feature extraction, content generation).
-  **Output Module**: Finalizes the output for delivery or storage.

### Workflow

-  **Data Collection**: The Input Module gathers raw data from sources.
-  **Sequential Processing**: Data moves through each Processing Module, undergoing transformations.
-  **Output Generation**: The Output Module compiles the final product.

### Potential Use Cases

-  **Personalized Marketing Content**: Data on customer behavior is processed to generate tailored marketing materials.
-  **End-to-End Document Processing**: Scanning physical documents, extracting text, translating content, and summarizing information.
-  **Automated Video Creation**: Generating scripts, creating animations, adding voice-overs, and editing into a final video.

## AI Mesh Networks

### Description

An AI Mesh Network is a decentralized architecture where multiple AI components (nodes) operate independently yet collaborate through direct communication. This pattern allows for distributed processing and resilience, as the system doesn't rely on a central coordinator.

### Components

-  **AI Nodes**: Independent AI agents capable of processing and decision-making.
-  **Communication Protocols**: Standards that enable nodes to exchange information efficiently.
-  **Shared Knowledge Base (optional)**: A repository where nodes can contribute and access collective data.

### Workflow

-  **Local Processing**: Each AI Node processes data independently.
-  **Peer Communication**: Nodes share results and insights with neighboring nodes.
-  **Collective Decision-Making**: Nodes adjust their actions based on shared information, leading to emergent system behavior.

### Potential Use Cases

-  **Decentralized Energy Grids**: Smart meters and appliances communicate to optimize energy consumption across a network.
-  **Collaborative Robotics**: Robots in a warehouse coordinate tasks like sorting and packaging without central control.
-  **Disaster Monitoring**: Sensor networks detect environmental changes, share data, and collectively assess risks.

### Example Implementation

```flip

// Primary AI that generates content based on a prompt
fun generate-content prompt revision_context=null:
  if(revision_context >> is-null?(),
    // Initial content generation - pass prompt directly
    prompt >> `Create content based on this prompt`,

    // Revision based on feedback - pass context object
    {
      prompt: prompt,
      previous_content: revision_context.previous_content,
      feedback: revision_context.feedback
    } >> `Revise the content based on the provided prompt, previous content, and feedback`
  )

// Secondary AI that evaluates content for quality and criteria
fun evaluate-content content criteria:
  {
    content: content,
    criteria: criteria
  } >> `Evaluate this content based on the provided criteria. For each criterion, provide a score (1-10), specific feedback, and whether it meets the criterion (true/false). Return as structured JSON.` >> object()

// Function to check if all criteria are met
fun all-criteria-met evaluation:
  evaluation.criteria >> map(criterion -> criterion.meets_criteria) >> every(x -> x == true)

// Function to extract actionable feedback from evaluation
