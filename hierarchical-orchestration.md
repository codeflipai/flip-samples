## Hierarchical AI Orchestration

### Description

Hierarchical AI Orchestration structures AI components in a multi-tiered hierarchy, resembling an organizational chart. Higher-level AIs focus on strategic decisions and oversee the coordination among lower-level AIs, which handle more granular tasks. This pattern enables complex decision-making processes by delegating responsibilities appropriately across the hierarchy.

### Components

-  **Strategic AI (Top Level)**: Sets overarching goals and priorities.
-  **Tactical AIs (Middle Level)**: Develop plans and strategies to meet the goals.
-  **Operational AIs (Bottom Level)**: Execute specific tasks and operations as per plans.

### Workflow

-  **Goal Definition**: The Strategic AI defines high-level objectives based on input data or directives.
-  **Plan Development**: Tactical AIs create actionable plans to achieve these objectives.
-  **Task Execution**: Operational AIs carry out the tasks outlined in the plans.
-  **Monitoring and Feedback**: Information flows back up the hierarchy for performance assessment and adjustments.

### Potential Use Cases

-  **Smart Manufacturing**: Strategic AI optimizes production goals, Tactical AIs manage supply chain logistics, and Operational AIs control machinery operations.
-  **Autonomous Fleet Management**: Managing a fleet of delivery drones where high-level AI plans routes, mid-level AI schedules deliveries, and low-level AI pilots the drones.
-  **Financial Portfolio Management**: Strategic AI sets investment goals, Tactical AIs allocate assets, and Operational AIs execute trades.

## AI Feedback Loops

### Description

The AI Feedback Loops pattern involves multiple AI components interacting in a cyclical manner. The output of one AI serves as the input for another, creating a continuous loop that refines results iteratively. This pattern enhances system performance through self-correction and adaptation based on feedback.

### Components

-  **Primary AI**: Generates initial outputs.
-  **Secondary AI**: Evaluates, critiques, or enhances the outputs of the Primary AI.
-  **Feedback Mechanism**: Facilitates communication between AIs for iterative improvement.

### Workflow

-  **Initial Output**: The Primary AI produces an output based on input data.
-  **Evaluation**: The Secondary AI analyzes the output for quality, accuracy, or compliance.
-  **Feedback Integration**: The Primary AI receives feedback and adjusts its processing accordingly.
-  **Iteration**: Steps 1â€“3 repeat until the desired quality is achieved.

### Potential Use Cases

-  **Refined Language Translation**: One AI translates text; another reviews for context and idiomatic expressions, enhancing the translation iteratively.
-  **Automated Coding**: An AI writes code based on requirements; a secondary AI reviews for bugs or inefficiencies, leading to improved code quality.
-  **Medical Diagnosis**: An AI suggests a diagnosis; another AI cross-checks with medical databases to confirm or refine the diagnosis.

### Example Implementation

```flip
