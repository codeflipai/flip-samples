## Hierarchical AI Orchestration

### Description

Hierarchical AI Orchestration structures AI components in a multi-tiered hierarchy, resembling an organizational chart. Higher-level AIs focus on strategic decisions and oversee the coordination among lower-level AIs, which handle more granular tasks. This pattern enables complex decision-making processes by delegating responsibilities appropriately across the hierarchy.

### Components

-  **Strategic AI (Top Level)**: Sets overarching goals and priorities.
-  **Tactical AIs (Middle Level)**: Develop plans and strategies to meet the goals.
-  **Operational AIs (Bottom Level)**: Execute specific tasks and operations as per plans.

### Workflow

-  **Goal Definition**: The Strategic AI defines high-level objectives based on input data or directives.
-  **Plan Development**: Tactical AIs create actionable plans to achieve these objectives.
-  **Task Execution**: Operational AIs carry out the tasks outlined in the plans.
-  **Monitoring and Feedback**: Information flows back up the hierarchy for performance assessment and adjustments.

### Potential Use Cases

-  **Smart Manufacturing**: Strategic AI optimizes production goals, Tactical AIs manage supply chain logistics, and Operational AIs control machinery operations.
-  **Autonomous Fleet Management**: Managing a fleet of delivery drones where high-level AI plans routes, mid-level AI schedules deliveries, and low-level AI pilots the drones.
-  **Financial Portfolio Management**: Strategic AI sets investment goals, Tactical AIs allocate assets, and Operational AIs execute trades.

## AI Feedback Loops

### Description

The AI Feedback Loops pattern involves multiple AI components interacting in a cyclical manner. The output of one AI serves as the input for another, creating a continuous loop that refines results iteratively. This pattern enhances system performance through self-correction and adaptation based on feedback.

### Components

-  **Primary AI**: Generates initial outputs.
-  **Secondary AI**: Evaluates, critiques, or enhances the outputs of the Primary AI.
-  **Feedback Mechanism**: Facilitates communication between AIs for iterative improvement.

### Workflow

-  **Initial Output**: The Primary AI produces an output based on input data.
-  **Evaluation**: The Secondary AI analyzes the output for quality, accuracy, or compliance.
-  **Feedback Integration**: The Primary AI receives feedback and adjusts its processing accordingly.
-  **Iteration**: Steps 1â€“3 repeat until the desired quality is achieved.

### Potential Use Cases

-  **Refined Language Translation**: One AI translates text; another reviews for context and idiomatic expressions, enhancing the translation iteratively.
-  **Automated Coding**: An AI writes code based on requirements; a secondary AI reviews for bugs or inefficiencies, leading to improved code quality.
-  **Medical Diagnosis**: An AI suggests a diagnosis; another AI cross-checks with medical databases to confirm or refine the diagnosis.

### Example Implementation

```flip
// Strategic AI - Top level decision maker
fun strategic-ai input:
  input >> `As the strategic AI, analyze this situation and determine high-level objectives and priorities. Return a structured strategic plan.`

// Tactical AIs - Middle level planners for different domains
fun financial-tactical-ai strategy:
  strategy >> `As a financial planning tactical AI, develop a detailed budget and investment plan based on this strategic plan.`

fun marketing-tactical-ai strategy:
  strategy >> `As a marketing tactical AI, develop a comprehensive marketing campaign strategy based on this strategic plan.`

fun operations-tactical-ai strategy:
  strategy >> `As an operations tactical AI, develop a detailed logistics and supply chain plan based on this strategic plan.`

// Operational AIs - Bottom level executors
fun budgeting-ai financial_plan:
  financial_plan >> `As a budgeting operational AI, create specific budget allocations with detailed line items based on this financial plan.`

fun advertising-ai marketing_plan:
  marketing_plan >> `As an advertising operational AI, create specific ad campaigns with targeting parameters, creative briefs, and channel strategies.`

fun logistics-ai operations_plan:
  operations_plan >> `As a logistics operational AI, create detailed shipping schedules, inventory requirements, and warehouse operations plans.`

// Feedback collection AI - gathers information from lower levels
fun feedback-collection-ai operational_results:
  operational_results >> `Analyze these operational results and summarize key insights, challenges, and opportunities for strategic adjustment.`

// Main orchestration function
fun hierarchical-orchestration input:
  let([
    // Level 1: Strategic planning
    strategic_plan: input >> strategic-ai,

    // Level 2: Tactical planning across domains
    financial_plan: strategic_plan >> financial-tactical-ai,
    marketing_plan: strategic_plan >> marketing-tactical-ai,
    operations_plan: strategic_plan >> operations-tactical-ai,

    // Level 3: Operational execution
    budget_details: financial_plan >> budgeting-ai,
    ad_campaigns: marketing_plan >> advertising-ai,
    logistics_schedule: operations_plan >> logistics-ai,

    // Collect all operational results
    operational_results: {

      logistics: logistics_schedule
    },

    // Feedback up the hierarchy
    strategic_feedback: operational_results >> feedback-collection-ai
  ],
  // Return comprehensive response with all levels
  {
    input_scenario: input,
    strategic_level: strategic_plan,
    tactical_level: {

      marketing: marketing_plan,
      operations: operations_plan
    },

// Example usage with a business scenario
main:
  "Our company is launching an autonomous drone delivery service in three major cities. We need a comprehensive plan covering financial requirements, marketing strategy, and operational logistics. Budget constraint is $10 million for the first year."
