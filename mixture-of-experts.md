## Mixture of Experts

### Description

The Mixture of Experts pattern involves a collaborative assembly of specialized AI models, each an expert in a specific domain or function. A central AI component, often referred to as the Gatekeeper or Task Manager, decomposes complex tasks into subtasks and intelligently routes each subtask to the appropriate expert AI. Once the experts process their respective subtasks, the results are aggregated to form a cohesive final output.

### Components

-  **Task Manager AI**: Analyzes the overall task, decomposes it, and assigns subtasks.
-  **Routing AI**: Determines the best expert for each subtask based on criteria like expertise, workload, and past performance.
-  **Expert AIs**: Specialized models trained for specific domains (e.g., language translation, image recognition, sentiment analysis).
-  **Aggregator AI**: Integrates outputs from expert AIs into a unified result.

### Workflow

-  **Task Reception**: The system receives a complex task from a user or another system.
-  **Task Decomposition**: The Task Manager AI breaks down the task into manageable subtasks.
-  **Expert Assignment**: The Routing AI assigns each subtask to the most suitable Expert AI.
-  **Subtask Processing**: Expert AIs process their assigned subtasks independently.
-  **Result Aggregation**: The Aggregator AI combines the outputs, ensuring consistency and coherence.
-  **Feedback Loop**: The system learns from outcomes to improve future task assignments and processing.

### Potential Use Cases

-  **Automated Content Creation**: Generating comprehensive reports or articles by dividing them into research, writing, editing, and fact-checking, each handled by specialized AIs.
-  **Multimodal Data Processing**: In healthcare, processing patient data where one AI handles medical imaging, another processes lab results, and another analyzes patient history.
-  **Complex Customer Service**: Handling support tickets by routing issues to expert AIs specialized in billing, technical support, or account management.

### Example Implementation

```flip

// Define expert functions - each expert is specialized for a different task
fun language-expert input:
  input >> `Analyze this text for grammar and style improvements.`

fun sentiment-expert input:
  input >> `Analyze the sentiment in this text (positive, negative, or neutral).`

fun factual-expert input:
  input >> `Check this text for factual accuracy and provide corrections if needed.`

fun summarization-expert input:
  input >> `Summarize the key points from this text in bullet points.`

// Task Manager - decomposes the main task into subtasks with explicit task types
fun task-manager input:
  input >> `Break down this task into subtasks focused on these specific aspects:
  - Language analysis
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Factual verification
  - Summarization

  Return a JSON object with fields:
  - language_task: text for language analysis
  - sentiment_task: text for sentiment analysis
  - factual_task: text for factual verification
  - summary_task: text for summarization` >> object()

// Process all subtasks using appropriate experts
fun process-subtasks task-object:
  {
    language_result: task-object.language_task >> language-expert,
    sentiment_result: task-object.sentiment_task >> sentiment-expert,
    factual_result: task-object.factual_task >> factual-expert,
    summary_result: task-object.summary_task >> summarization-expert
  }

// Aggregator - combines expert outputs into a final result
fun aggregator results original-task:
  {
    task: original-task,
    expert_results: results
  } >> `You are a final aggregator. Based on these expert analyses,
  create a unified response that addresses the original task.`

// Main MoE function
fun mixture-of-experts task:
  let([
    // 1. Break down the task into specific subtasks
    subtasks: task-manager(task),

    // 2. Process all subtasks with their respective experts
    results: process-subtasks(subtasks),

    // 3. Combine the results
    final-output: aggregator(results, task)
  ], final-output)

// Example with realistic input
main:
  "Analyze how climate change affects global food security, focusing on wheat, rice, and maize production. Consider temperature changes, water availability, and extreme weather events."
  >> mixture-of-experts
